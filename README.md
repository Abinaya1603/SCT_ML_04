# âœ‹ Hand Gesture Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project implements a **Hand Gesture Recognition System** that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data.  
Using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, the model learns spatial features from gesture images and performs real-time classification through webcam input.  
This enables intuitive **humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI)** and **gesture-based control systems** for applications in robotics, gaming, and smart devices.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To develop a **deep learning-based hand gesture recognition model** that can automatically detect and classify various hand gestures with high accuracy, supporting real-time applications for touchless control and interaction.

## ðŸ§© Features
- Classifies multiple hand gestures from images or videos  
- Uses **CNN** for robust and efficient feature extraction  
- Supports **real-time recognition** via webcam  
- Provides live prediction overlay with gesture labels  
- Simple to train, extend, and deploy
